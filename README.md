# MLOps-01-Churn Analysis

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the application of MLOps practices in churn analysis. Churn analysis is a critical aspect of customer retention strategies, and through this project, we aim to streamline and automate the process using Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).

## Project Description
The `mlops-01-churn-analysis` project utilizes various machine learning models to predict customer churn based on historical data. The project is structured to facilitate continuous integration and delivery for machine learning systems, ensuring that the churn prediction models are always up-to-date and performant.

## Features
- Automated data pipelines for real-time churn analysis
- Continuous training and deployment of ML models
- Monitoring and logging for model performance
- Easy integration with existing CRM systems

## Tech Stack
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **MLOps Tools**: MLflow, Kubeflow, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (Minikube or equivalent)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:<br/>
    - git clone https://github.com/machinelearningzuu/mlops-01-churn-analysis.git <br/>
    - cd mlops-01-churn-analysis
  

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    - python -m venv venv
    - source venv/bin/activate
    - pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
  
3. Initialize the MLflow tracking server:
   - mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./artifacts --host 0.0.0.0
  
### Usage
To run the churn analysis pipeline, execute:

**python pipeline.py**
